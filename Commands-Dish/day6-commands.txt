    nodeSelector:
        env: test


# k create job myjob1 ——image=busybox --dye-run=client -o yaml —— sleep 20 > job.yaml
# k apply -f job.yaml

To perform 5 times.. Add below spec in job.yaml
Spec:
    Completions: 5

It will create 5 pods.. run in sequence
Add parallelism: 3 —> at any given point of time, 3 pods will be in running state.. till we have 5 completed ..


Cronjob… www.crontab.guru
# k create cj mycj1 —image=busybox ——schedule=“*/1 8 * * *” —dry-run=client -o yaml —— sleep 10 > mycj.yaml
# k delete myjob1
# k apply -f mycj.job
You can see one job created.. then in 60sec, new job will be created..  it will keep doing every min.. 


Daemonset —> create exactly one instance of pod on all the nodes.. e.g. monitoring tool to be present on each node (only one instance), logging, backup etc
Even if new 5 nodes added in the cluster, it will create a pod on all these new nodes. It is a type of controller used to run daemon type of application like monitoring, logging daemons

# k get pods -n kube-system -o wide
# k get ds —> kindnet and kube-proxy are two deamonsets.. which ensures that these pods will be created on each node (including master)

Pods by default are not allowed to be scheduled on master. Master will have some taint so not scheduled.
